# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds vLLM integration to the LLaMA LoRA fine-tuning framework to enable high-performance inference and serving capabilities. vLLM is a fast and memory-efficient library for LLM inference and serving that provides significant speedups through optimized CUDA kernels, PagedAttention, and continuous batching. This integration will allow users to serve their fine-tuned LoRA/DoRA models with production-grade performance while maintaining compatibility with the existing framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to serve my fine-tuned LoRA models using vLLM, so that I can achieve high-throughput inference with minimal latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a trained LoRA adapter THEN the system SHALL provide a command to serve the model using vLLM
2. WHEN serving with vLLM THEN the system SHALL automatically merge the LoRA adapter with the base model for optimal performance
3. WHEN the vLLM server starts THEN it SHALL expose OpenAI-compatible API endpoints for inference
4. WHEN multiple requests are received THEN vLLM SHALL handle continuous batching automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure vLLM serving parameters through the existing configuration system, so that I can optimize performance for my specific hardware setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring vLLM serving THEN the system SHALL support tensor parallelism configuration for multi-GPU setups
2. WHEN configuring vLLM serving THEN the system SHALL support memory optimization parameters like GPU memory utilization
3. WHEN configuring vLLM serving THEN the system SHALL support quantization options (FP16, BF16, INT8, INT4)
4. IF the user specifies invalid configuration THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested fixes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform offline batch inference using vLLM, so that I can process large datasets efficiently without running a server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing batch inference THEN the system SHALL support JSONL input format compatible with OpenAI batch API
2. WHEN processing batches THEN vLLM SHALL optimize memory usage through dynamic batching
3. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL output results in JSONL format with request IDs
4. WHEN an error occurs during batch processing THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining items and report errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy vLLM-powered models in distributed environments, so that I can scale inference across multiple nodes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying on multiple GPUs THEN the system SHALL support tensor parallelism configuration
2. WHEN deploying across multiple nodes THEN the system SHALL support pipeline parallelism with Ray
3. WHEN configuring distributed serving THEN the system SHALL validate hardware compatibility and resource allocation
4. IF distributed setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and fallback options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want vLLM integration to work seamlessly with existing model formats, so that I don't need to modify my current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing LoRA adapters THEN vLLM SHALL load them without requiring format conversion
2. WHEN using merged models THEN vLLM SHALL serve them directly without additional processing
3. WHEN switching between Transformers and vLLM backends THEN the API responses SHALL maintain compatibility
4. WHEN using different model architectures THEN the system SHALL automatically detect vLLM compatibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging for vLLM serving, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vLLM server is running THEN the system SHALL log throughput metrics (requests/second, tokens/second)
2. WHEN serving requests THEN the system SHALL track memory usage and GPU utilization
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs with context
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and diagnostic information
